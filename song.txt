Brothers of the mine rejoice!
Swing, swing, swing with me
Raise your pick and raise your voice!
Sing, sing, sing with me
Down and down into the deep,
Who knows what we'll find beneath?
Diamonds, rubies, gold and more
Hidden in the mountain store.

Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone.
Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home.
Skin made of iron, steel in our bones,
To dig and dig makes us free!
Come on brothers sing with me!

[Chorus]
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole!
